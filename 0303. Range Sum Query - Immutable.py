"""
Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Example:
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
Note:
You may assume that the array does not change.
There are many calls to sumRange function.
"""

"""
We can either have the convention of partialSum[i] = nums[0] + ... + nums[i] or partialSum[i] = nums[0] + ... + nums[i-1]. We will 
go with the second convention for majority of these range query problems.

Time: O(n) to construct, O(1) to serve. Space: O(n).
